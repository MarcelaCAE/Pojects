# Welcome to HR analytics Employee Attrition Project.

## About the Project
Welcome to my project! This project uses a simulated dataset that contains detailed information about employees, their roles, demographics, and job-related factors.

## Objective:
The goal of this project is to analyze employee attrition patterns and identify the factors that influence employees leaving the company based on the provided dataset.

## Tools Used:
Python libraries (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib), MySQL and Tableau. Please visit my tableau dashboard on the link https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/marcela.rompao/viz/HR_Analyics_Attrition/Dashboard1

## Dataset Overview:
Shape: The dataset contains 74,498 records (employees) and 21 variables (columns).
File Format: The dataset is provided in CSV format.
Source: The data is a simulated dataset designed to reflect real-world employee attrition scenarios.

Key Variables:
Employee ID: Unique identifier for each employee.
Age, Gender, and Marital Status: Demographic information about employees.
Job Role, Job Level, and Department: Information about the employee's role and position within the company.
Job Satisfaction, Performance Rating, and Work-Life Balance: Indicators of employee satisfaction and work conditions.

2. Employee Atrittion by Job Level vs Years at Company 
3. Employee Atrittion by Job Satisfation
4. Employee Atrittion by Monthy Income
5. Employee Atrittion by Work-life balance
6. KPI Employee engagement Score

## Techical Aproach
Handled Nulls, empty spaces and duplicates values.
Exploration the data by using descriptive statitics, frequency tables and groping categorial and numerical data into new categories to measure the attrition and the outliers (using SQL queries and high order python functions).

## Conclusion and Key Insights:
The analysis done showed that despite we have more people staying, we have a difference of 5% compared with the people leaving.
Main focus are the entry level and medium level, that are the level with more rotation.
The monthly income are higher on the technology and healthcare category and we have more people leaving on those.
KPI engagement score will help on decreasing attrition since will flag the employees with a lower score on work-life balance. monthly income, leadership opportunities and employee recognition.
